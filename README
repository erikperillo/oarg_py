oarg - omni arguments parser

oarg can parse multiple and positional args of any type. 

Parsing
You must specify keys(names) to represent your argument. For an integer value, for instance, it can be "-i" and "-integer". Note the dash at the beginning of the word. Every key MUST be preceded by a SINGLE dash.

example:
	./program.py -i 43

You can also give multiple arguments at once:
	./program.py -integer 23 1 232 3 -9

They must be separated by a space.

Positional arguments
Positional arguments are those that do not come after a dashed name. In "./program.py this 'is example' -i 34", for instance, the positional arguments are "this" and "is example".

Mixing things
You can mix positional with normal, positional with positional etc. To explicitly separate things, use a comma (,).

example:
	./program.py this is an, "good example"

In the arguments above, "this","is","an" will be considered three positional arguments for one thing and "good example" will be for other thing. You can also mix normal with positional just like:
	./program.py -float 3.2 32.2 -0.32938, another,example man

In the above, there will be two sets of positional arguments. To escape a comma (i.e. not use it as a separator), use "\,":
	./program.py "i do not want it\, man"

To use boolean values you can do:
	./program.py -b , "positional arg"
As well as:
	./program.py -b -i 2 1 2
